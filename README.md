Odin Project - Project: Landing page.
Welcome to my landing page project! This project is a simple yet effective landing page built using only HTML, CSS, and Flexbox. Flexbox, also known as Flexible Box Layout, is a CSS layout module that makes creating responsive and flexible web pages easy. The landing page is designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate. The layout uses Flexbox to create a responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes and orientations. The clean and well-organized HTML makes it easy to customize and add your content.
